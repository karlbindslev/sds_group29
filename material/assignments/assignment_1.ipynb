I was on the line for an hour, and after talking to two separate CSR's, with the supervisor Valerie being the most incompetent, they finally put me through to the loss prevention department where I was presented with an answering machine. Keep in mind that the first words out of my mouth when I called them was \"Can I speak to the loss prevention department please\". I strongly recommend no one ever do business with this company.\n",

      "TrueFacet helped me sell a piece of Tiffany jewelry that I no longer wanted, and with their help I sold my item within three months and received over 50% of the original retail price! The process was easy and TrueFacet's customer service was excellent. TrueFacet took my item and did all the work -- photographing the item, researching the sale price and writing the listing -- and their staff was helpful each step of the way. I wholeheartedly recommend TrueFacet to anyone looking to sell a piece of fine jewelry.\n",
      "The best Team Building activity we've ever done. TeamBonding was flexible and helped us schedule an activity at the last minute. They were very cooperative and the facilitators were down-to-earth and personable. We did the Teddy Rescue Bear (Build a Teddy Bear) activity and it was lots of fun. I would definitely do it again or try one of the other activities. The best parts are the games, puzzles, and trivia you have to complete to gain experience for the specific activity\n",

      "I like the clothes, and the prices seem good for the quality. I went to a pop-up store in Phoenix not long ago (drove 2 hours to get there) and was disappointed in the set-up. There were no long mirrors, only a \"skinny\" mirror propped on a chair. It elongated my body, so I had to rely on my daughter's picture-taking skills with my phone to see how the clothes actually looked on me. It didn't work, so I didn't buy anything. Your pop-ups should have tall, regular ol' mirrors.\n",

After not hearing from anyone in weeks I called and they schedule an appointment. My delivery came and cabinets was discolored, damaged, not painted in areas, missing parts and doors. I called and was told it was on back order and I have not received anything yet. It’s been weeks. No one followerd up with me. On top of that they left a cabinet on the porch. Once my contractor started putting up cabinets he noticed three different area of cabinets space is either to small to fit all cabinets  or to big for the cabinets to fit from the beginning to end of the wall.  The space was measured by the company twice. She came out to check measurements. At this time I have no answers. No one has returned my calls and I still don’t have my missing parts. Don’t get any cabinets  from here if have had read these reviews before I purchased you cabinets. I would have ran fast! But a friend recommended this place so I went off of her experience.\n",
      "Good company and overall a fast and painless experience. The only thing was that customer service did not know where my bag was at one point and reached out to me to give a bag description. That made me feel a little nervous but my bag arrived on time and with no problems. Thanks!\n",

Prices are already reasonable and I can usually find a coupon online too. Overall very pleased!\n",

      "I really like the aspect that we planned a few days longer than our tickets lasted.  That way, we used up the tickets in the first several days in the city, then used the last couple days to visit things we saw while traveling between the CityPASS ticket venues.  In Philadelphia in particular, there is an upgrade on the Philadelphia Trolly Works and Big Bus Company ticket from a 2 day ride pass to an 8 day ride pass.  I strongly recommend this upgrade as it will make getting around the city much cheaper and easier (as you can park at the Constitution Center all day and ride from there instead of finding your own way everywhere).\n",

Comparable prices to competition, but at least for the products I bought, (Optimum Nutrition - various natural protein powders), they seem to have decent prices on all items as opposed to some sites which have 1 or 2 items low priced (loss leaders), and then the rest at high prices.

      "First time experience with Rooms Place and have already began informing our social network to look elsewhere. First impression was decent when we walked into store for first time. We saw a couch we liked and decided we would purchase at the Castleton location. There was an apparent Father’s Day sale of 20% we received. We put down $100 to hold the couch so we could go home and ensure the measurements would fit. We returned a little more than a week later to make final purchase. The original lady we worked with was not in that day. When we went to finalize things we were aggressively encouraged to buy the warranty. We said multiple times we were not interested in the warranty until we were informed if we didn’t buy the warranty the 20% discount would not apply. I found this to be completely shady and not buying the warranty and losing the discount was never mentioned in the beginning and was no where to be found in any of the written terms. I was not in the mood to fight at the time so we just purchased the warranty even though I had a feeling this was a shady practice and we were getting ripped off. We were also informed we could finance for 0% for 24 months the first time but then told it could only be for 18 months when we came back to finalize purchase. All this was one thing. Now, at this time, I’m writing this review after 9pm on a Saturday when we were told delivery would be between 3 and 6pm. We were called to let us know the delivers were hours behind and it could be as late as 8:30 but here we are at almost 9:30 with no communication and no couch delivered. At this point I’m not sure if we’ll even get the expected delivery tonight and I will be expecting a 100% refund for delivery fees and expect the couches to still be delivered. The majority of the experience with Rooms Place has been pretty pitiful since the beginning and I only hope management knows enough business and customer service sense to make things right for us. If you’re genuine about improving things and optimizing your business, there is some serious work to done and I hope it begins with correcting this experience of first time customers.\n",

However, when paying for my dinner, the card didn't work, which was extremely embarrassing!

However, the site did not say that orders would be sent ONCE VERIFIED BY PHONE and it took 2 days for me to actually talk to someone before the vouchers were sent.  Every time I called the number noted in the email, I rec'd a recording saying all representatives were busy and someone would call me back.  We played phone tag (as I was at work during the day and am not allowed personal calls) for 48 hours which delayed my delivery.   The gift cards were for a basket for Nurse's Week and we almost did not make the deadline---which we easily would have made if the vouchers had been sent as promised.  I still do not understand the \"verification\" process; they wanted my name, address and charge card---information that I had already provided.  I appreciated the discount on the cards, but it was not as easy getting the cards as advertised.\n",

It seems that it is current policy to just replace the vehicle if that happens. The replacement car nad not been serviced and the oil warning light kept flashing on, there was a winter tyre on the drivers front side which gave a terrible drive. New car, no handbook.

      "1. One.com expects you to manually Cancel your subscription 1 month before the expiry of your hosting plan by contacting their customer care, otherwise you are auto renewed and charged for the subsequent year. Unlike other well known hosting providers who cancel the hosting plan by default on non payment of renewal fee(unless the customer decides to go for auto renewal), One.com forces auto renewal on all it's customers. As of reminders about the expiry of hosting plan, while others send atleast 5 to 6 reminders, One.com sends only 1 reminder, having missed which you are bound to be auto renewed. The Customer care is prompt enough to show the terms & condition to the customers.\r\n",

      "2. After the expiry of due date(15 days before the expiry of the Hosting Plan), one.com expects you to Pay an extra 12$ as a reminder fees every time they send you a mail reminding you to pay your due amount. So expect a bill of somewhere around 12$ every month as reminder fees, in case you fail to pay renewal fees for a website that was forcibly renewed without your consent. The customer care have their usual excuse \"Please read the terms & conditions\"\r\n",

For the domain you are supposed to pay an additional $13.8/yr, thus making the grand total of $31.2/yr.

The place is relatively clean and fairly well managed, but it lacks conveniences.  For example, the doors to the climate-controlled building does not have a proper ramp.  So, you struggle to bring the cart from the entrance to the building.  Secondly, after-hours access is a separate request that you have to make.  Overall, it is worth your time and money.\n",

We found time and time again we'd go through to pay the listed price, to find the end price was nothing like first quoted and had to bail - example - list price for a Dubai hotel $1.6k, actual price $2.7k.

Said i had about 2 days to accept the quote. When I went to book and pay, I received a confirmation and email that said we were good. A few minutes later received another email saying that Im sorry but we booked with someone else for that day and time. Very disappointing to say the least! Not sure I can blame gigsalad for this, but it would be nice to have functionality that provides updates so this type of confusion doesn't happen again.

There was only one time when a plant was delivered in bad condition and it was immediately replaced. The website is easy to use and easy to place orders.  Don't know what kind of plant to get? No problem, just use the plant finder page! LOVE this company!!!! I have ordered from other companies as well, but none compare to Bluestone Perrenials! I also appreciate that you send out notification emails when an order has shipped so I know to watch for it.  Other companies I've used don't do that and it leaves me guessing when I'm going to get a delivery. I will continue to use Bluestone Perrenials for years to come!  Keep up the great work!!!!\n",

Because there were 4 adults & 1 infant my criteria were an estate car, at the best price from a company with an on-airport office, this limited my choice of deals. I had to pay for a full tank of fuel, but I used nearly all of it. I also heard that many companies were now finding minor faults on return and charging inflated repair prices, so I paid the 6E a day full insurance - expensive, but meant no-worries. I was directed to INTERRENT (which is part of Europcar). They were quick, but did not have the model of the estate that I had booked available, so without any fuss or extra-charge gave us a big diesel VW, which was a really good car. Return was also very quick. We felt sorry for Goldcar customers who had a huge queue to wade through.\n",

If you offer an item for a specific price....make sure it is that price and not higher with a bunch of add-ons.  I am busy and don't have time to play games.  We also ordered the assortment of colors.  We only received 2 colors.  We were told that it was because that was the way they were randomly packaged.....well, we received one box of red and one box of black.  There is nothing random about it.  They did send us 20 more of a different color at no cost, but I would rather not waste time calling them.\n",

Other than being affordable you can see which items are actually high quality because of the reviews that other users leave for them, which I always pay attention to.

      "3 weeks after buying from Buydig I've got no merchandise and no refund.  Their idiotic shipping policies, which they tried to blame on FedEx, that refused to allow FedEx to resend or allow me to pick up myself.  This resulted in it eventually being returned for basically no reason other then Buydig not wanting me to actually receive the on sale TV.  Their policy is that when a thing is returned you have to re-buy it, of course the return process takes so long that by the time you eventually get your money back, I still haven't after 3 or so weeks, the sale is off and you now have to pay normal price. \n",

It looked like the same thing online, but when it arrived (very quickly I will say), I could see the the image was not nearly as clear as mine.

I went to my bank and they informed me that the payment went through, and the company has to reverse the transaction.

I've called more than 6 times, been on hold 30 minutes each time and still haven't spoken to any agent.\n",

I typed in the requested information regarding my vehicle, ie; year, make, model etc., and the PartsGeek website indicated which AC Delco parts kit I needed.  I ordered the part and paid about $40.00 including shipping, and received the kit promptly.  The part was not the correct part for my vehicle.  PartsGeek is willing to refund my money upon me returning the filter kit.  It will cost me $14.95 to ship the kit back. The problem is the PartsGeek website is flawed and not detailed enough to make sure customers are ordering the correct parts.  I own four vehicles and do all my maintenance myself.  I order all the time from Rock Auto, Summit and A1 Auto.  Never had a problem with them.  Not sure I'll give PartsGeek another chance.\n",

Tried to contact them, they asked the time for one week and they do not even reply to the emails. I have copies of all the emails I sent and just one or two recieved from them. Very poor customer service. I have found out few other options to unlock but iphoneimei.net is not even responding to the refund. I have sent them so many emails.

All though you fill out all the info booking on line, you have to wait in line to give all the information all over again to be hand written. Have gotten the same employee on drop off the last three times. Acts like he is doing you a royal favor by accepting your information and keys. He was almost done and my husband asked the shuttle bus to wait a minute and the driver said he couldn't. We got on the next one and the driver said we would leave in 5 minutes. Then he disappeared. When he got near again, I asked him when we were leaving as it had been over 5 minutes and he actually denied he said that! He wanted to wait for another couple who were at the check in desk.

      "I spent over an hour walking around NYC trying to find where to board the bus...even after getting direction 3Xs from people who should know the area (policemen in patrol car, garbage man, an commercial vehicle parking garage). The street address in the email sent out is not quiet accruate either. I had to call you, Go Bus, and speak to a customer service rep, who help find the bus. The bus pass me as I had gotten close which also help me to find it but once do I got there, the bus driver was very abrupt and rude. I walk up to the bus as the driver was coming off the bus and before I could ask him anything, he just walk off the bus and past me saying (with poor english), \"too soon bus.\" I turned to asked him another question, saying excuse me, sir...sir...excuse! He kept walking and ignored me. I repeated myself saying the same words a little louder in case he did not me but he kept on walking. It was first time riding the bus. Not the best experience if you hold any importance to word of mouth...for obvious reasons. The ride itself and the fact I got to my finally destination early after a horrible experience because of the bad Nor'easter storm that hit the area in the form of heavy rain and wind left me stranded in NYC at the airport with no place to stay and an exceptionally large smount of money for a Urber to a noisy little sleepless night at an Airbnb. The the bus was my only alternative way home. My seat was not clean either. So yeah...there's allllll of that. Side note: if you consider rethinking the first bus departure schedule for the bus that leave NYC to BOS so it coordinate with first Long Island Long Beach train arriving at Penn station, that would be nice too. I was in a panic trying to get back to Boston for work after all other form of transport was either canceled, sold out or not running to get from point A to B. Thanks\n",

They emailed me that standard service was not available and had an option for a full refund or they would send a zip file with instructions to unlock by usb cable.

They warn you final step can take 20 minutes to get codes to unlock but they don't tell it will be embedded in the program. You expect screen will change displaying the codes but doesn't  the codes show in red Also they indicate \"DeFreeze\" code but actually shows as \"Freeze\" After entering two codes nothing happen so i tried a phone restart and did at one point  think I had bricked the phone as it got locked in a android menu screen.

      "I have been shopping online with Thriftbooks for just about a year now after my eldest daughter found out about it at school.  It is a wonderful site for finding quality used books at a great price!  We are usually shopping for books for school or research, but Thriftbooks has a very large selection of many genres!  I particularly love the wish list feature, which allows you to be contacted if they do not currently have a book in stock.  Even the most obscure title I've been looking for has been located on this site.  I also love their fast shipping, which is usually free depending on your order total (it's easy to get free shipping with so many great books to choose from!).  I will use this site often, and highly recommend them!\n",

I contacted Roi and asked if it was possible to have the stone changed in the ring to an Aquamarine and sure enough it was!  I purchased the ring on March 1 and today, March 11, I received it!  The craftsmanship is stunning and the ring is perfect. Roi worked with me every step of the way from offering ways to size her without her knowing, to shipping options to just keeping me posted on the progress.  Roi was incredibly easy to work with and I could not recommend someone more!  His work is one of a kind and absoultey stunning.  On top of that, there was an appraisal of the ring with it and THE BOX HAS AN LED LIGHT IN IT!! As a theatre professional, that little detail makes me smile and laugh and appreciate the obvious pride he takes in his work.  Thank you Roi and the Vidarjewelry team for making this the best experience I've had buying jewelry and for making an incredible piece for me! \n",

      "I will never use Groupon again. I used Groupon a few times in the past, mostly for restaurant discounts, I did not trust the refurbished Beats and Macbooks. So my sister told me to get my nephew an XBOX Live Gold card on Groupon, I did. How can they mess up an Xbox Live card, right.  Well they sell ones from Brazil that will not work in the US. Then they will not refund the purchase. they go through the motions, ask you to send proof (ie screen shots, pictures of the card) to Support Services and then never respond back.  What makes it even worse is they are continuing to sell these.\n",

But a simple itemized receipt? A quick win as an easy thing to improve.  Please.  You're too good to have something so minor mar your attractiveness as a business entity.    ... I would still do business with them again - and gladly so.\n",

The service was canceled cause of constant beeps on phone during conversations. They could not fix my outgoing caller ID either. Avoid phone power at all cost.\n",

For the amount of money you are paying for these bouquets, you can go to your local grocery store and get something four times as nice. They are overpriced and inconsistent.

      "I purchased 6 e-giftcards for Bed Bath & Beyond. They were for varying amounts, but the listings were otherwise identical. Three of them worked on the BB&B website, the other three would produce errors. After several emails and phone calls to GiftCards.com, BB&B, and Google (since they are a \"Google trusted site\"), I found out that the ones that were causing errors were merchandise credits, which cannot be used on BB&B's website. The listing did not indicate this, and I would not have purchased them otherwise, as it is not convenient for me to go to BB&B store. GiftCards.com was unresponsive to my emails, rude to me on the phone, and the issue was not resolved to my satisfaction. Will never use again; not worth it for a 5-10% discount.\n",
      "Ordering process and shipping was great.  Unfortunately one of the products I ordered lasted only two days.  I ordered six 8.5x11 clear display holders with magnetic backs - within the first 24 hours of assembling and mounting them one fell down on its own and broke, and within the next day three more had fallen and cracked. The magnetic strips were put on the holders, pressed evenly and firmly, and allowed to sit for one hour before putting them on the metal surfaces. Each time one fell it was because the holder had separated from the magnet.  The adhesive between the magnet and holder needs a big upgrade.\n",
      "From the beginning, the broker selling the boat was slow to respond to requests for info, pics, etc. When we actually set up a time to view and inspect the boat, I inquired if we could do the closing the same day if the boat was acceptable, as it was a 6 hour trip to get to the boat, and I wanted to avoid making this trip twice just to sign my name and hook up to the boat. Broker said twice it wasn't possible to close on the same day, then the morning of said maybe it was possible....back and forth. After we saw the boat and we're waiting (again) to hear from the broker about closing, I went around him and spoke to the closing coordinator, who actually new what she was doing and said it would be no problem to close same day (apparently the broker had no idea of this.) We also wasted about 1.5 hours because the broker didn't make an effort to have the boat delivered to the closing office as we requested- which instead causes us to travel out of our way twice when we didn't need to. There was no customer service from the broker- nothing was done by him to make the process as seamless as possible. I feel he didn't have any experience in sales or in customer service. We were able to close the same day, which is not the norm for this company. With a different broker I would give them another shot.\n",

There was plenty of room for all 6 members of our family, even with 2 of our kids being adults. The decorations are very nice and makes the whole place very cozy, comfortable and relaxing. You will not be wishing you brought extra pillows, that’s for sure! The pier is right across the road and super easy to keep an eye on our boys fishing from inside the house and of course from the super awesome porch. The house is very dog friendly. Also, Port O’Conner is a quick drive if you want to enjoy the beach during your stay, we loved that too.

I told the guy that I wanted to speak to a manager because it was their fault that the workmanship of the items was crappy and I wanted my shipping refunded. In the end they refunded me the entire amount of the order. I was VERY DISSATISFIED with the quality of the products I ordered, but I was really impressed with they way they handled refunding my money and trying to make it right.\n",

When we started having delays with the listing agent, he got on it with both the listing and our agent to get things done.  We even got a check back from VU for using the agent they recommended and we got money back at closing too.  I really couldn't have asked for anything more.  We love our new house!\n",

I also considered some simple coil sprung seat posts and Crane Creek's Thudbuster, but the Suntour had the right quality and price point even with oversea shipping charges. These were not readily available here in Canada. Even my local bike shop was unwilling to source them out for me. Xxcycle did a great job packaging and shipping it in a timely manner. I would definitely keep them bookmarked on my browser for consideration of future bicycle related purchases.\n",

That's a little aggravating. One time I believe I ordered a book from Textbook Rush, the book was a Instructors Edition or International, I can't remember. The book was taped up to hide it. I returned the book for a refund with no issues, but it was a inconvenience. Other than that I think I'm pretty pleased with my experience with Textbook Rush.\n",

Another reason i like them is that when i pick the car up there is usually a full tank of petrol. When i take it back i just have to make sure it has the same amount of petrol in as when i picked it up. Other car rental companies give you the car and charge you for the petrol in the car on receipt (not the same price as the current cost of petrol) and then when you take it back you either drive back on fumes or leave them with extra petrol you have put in and it costs you both times - on top of the car rental itself\n",

I decided to search, myself... too many (1,038) websites that had these particular  frames,BUT discontinued.My daughter, who is an opthamologist, said she would help me search.After 3+ hours I came across RLE...my daughter,searched  only five minutes, came to me, and she tells me she found a website AND it was the same one I was on-TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,and they had the particular frames. I ordered them.I  finally after calling Replcement Lens Express-RLE (couldnt get through via phone) I wrote an e-mail to RLE.Stephanie replied,mentioning that CT had been receiving  horrific weather,and  it had affected business-I can relate-living In ND,It didnt  enter my mind, that this might be the reason. I thought I got scammed again-my Visa bank card was hacked and used at over seven stores after Christmas. Stephanie kapt in touch with me via e-mail, constantly...like I was an important customer. Finally, the frames arrived. My optical company couldnt believe it, and Im sure theyll remember your store name, because I raved about the customer service- Stephanie-and how she me feel at ease because they werent shipped RIGHT AWAY...she is the best!!!  If it hadnt been for the  severity of the weather my mind wouldnt have been thinking the worst... have been bed-ridden most of the time since November, so my mind thought of a few reasons for the delay.  It taught me a lesson-to be more patient, and if it hadnt been for Stephanie with CONSTANT status updates......and that all this is just DETAILS in the major course of our lifetimes.Thank you for EVERYTHING and thank Stephanie for her kind replies and updates.Sincerely, Judy A.

I have been with them for a very long time and can always count on sending a message that is unique and, depending of the occasion find a card that perfectly salutes the occasion.

Kudos Smilebox!\n",

I decided to do a first time try with sunglasses as I have astigmatism and wear progressive lens and I know that there are more dynamics involved with that. I ordered my sunglasses (WileyX) and not only did Frames Direct have the best cost on the frames, they were amazing on the cost of the lens. I went with the best Transition lenses with all the coatings and they beat all my local shops by at least 200.00. I received the glasses in a timeframe stated by Frames Direct and tFrames Direct highly athey are awesome. I went to my local shop to have the frames fitted properly and they verified that the prescription was filled properly. I recommend Frames Direct highly, at least for my long distance non-progressive glasses, as to date that is all I have sampled.\n",

They carefully explain the entire loan process and guide you through each of the necessary steps.

      "I ordered an engraved stethoscope from Medisave and chose the $13 fedex delivery option (only a few more dollars than the cheapest delivery option). My order was placed on a Sunday and received by Wednesday. Medisave sent me emails during the entire process including when my order was received, sent to fedex, and delivered by fedex along with the tracking info for my package so I could track it on the fedex website as well. I had a question about a code I needed to gain full access to the Littmann learning app and received prompt attention by their chat option on the Medisave website. My inquiry was handled quickly and I also immediately received an email containing my chat interaction and to make sure I was satisfied. Highly recommend this company plus their engraving was cheaper than other websites, came out exactly as expected, and faster delivery than other websites quoted for engraved stethoscopes.

I searched around different dealerships but ended up sticking with carmax. I found a 2016 Mazda3 sport which I love. Very low miles on it and I got free shipping to ship it from North Carolina. It took 5 days for them to ship my car and I bought it on the 7th day. All I paid was $305 for the down payment and roadloans took care of everything else. The process did not take very long at all. About 2 weeks for everything. To do the paperwork and carmax fueled up and cleaned the car, it took about 2hr 30min. Great experience. I would definitely reccomend to someone else.\n",

I will definitely shop with them again...and with confidence that if I have ANY problems that the folks in customer service will really pull through! Great job! Great company!!   OLD REVIEW---I regularly shop by mail order for my garden plants, so I have experience with this type of business. Of 25 plants ordered, only ten were in good condition upon arrival. 3 were badly damaged by improper packing, 1 more was broken at the base and was beyond survival. The plants clearly had not been watered for some time ahead of shipping and arrived in very stressed condition. They were immediately unpacked, watered and put in a dappled shade situation to allow to recover from shipping shock, which took five days rather that the usual two or so. Still, in total, 5 plants did not survive. I can not recommend this company.\n",

I searched high and low on Amazon since I have Amazon Prime but was unable to find the parts I needed at a reasonable price.  Dyers came up in my search and they had the parts at a reasonable price and shipping was also reasonable.  The only question in my mind is whether or not I would get them in time.  I decided to give them a shot.  I placed the order on Sunday morning and my parts arrived on Wednesday afternoon.   I believe I paid $8 for regular shipping.  I got the parts installed on Wednesday night and our generator worked flawlessly for our weekend of tailgating.

When the initial foundation repair did not work as hoped they absolutely stood behind their warranty (even when they technically may not have had to) and replaced the repair with a new stabilization system that had come out at no expense to me.

I would give them a 5-star rating except for the fact that one pair of my socks (my favorite ones, sadly) fell apart after just two washes.  These are expensive socks so I would not expect them to rip apart along the seams so quickly. I bought eight pairs so I will have to see how the rest of them hold up. For now, I am loving the remaining seven pairs of socks and will probably buy more.\n",
      "I purchased a Laptop $600.- from HP (HP Laptop 15Z000) I am disappointed. Shipping was good. After 2 weeks the Laptop turned it self off. Called Customer service, they pushed on me a 3 Year warranty and the McAffee virus program this cost me over $200.-. They told me after that we can fix the problem. After several days and hours with a technician I think the problem was fixed. Then I had a problem with my touchpad, still have the problem. Called HP, I thought I had a warranty, not so the $200.- 3 year warranty was only for software problems. Now I have a hardware problem. It is not covered under this warranty. My touchpad is very sensitive, tried to adjust it with software, no luck. often the pointer jumps around, then deleting in the middle of writing a letter or email half of it and had to rewrite again. Opens up automatically websites. The touchpad left and right click is horrible, have to touch only a small section of the right or left button so it get recognized. The turn on button is not good at all. It is a small rectangle bar. When you push this button you don't know, did it turn on the Laptop or not. Because it takes a while until the hp logo appears on the screen. No other sign of life. A round start button with a light coming on would be great. I would not recommend Hp to buy a computer. Customer service tries to sell you only warranties. Searched online what I should do with my Touchpad. Recommendation is Live with it, because when you send it to Hp repair you have to deal on the end only with more problems.\n",

      "I ordered a pair of Serengeti Velocity Rx sunglasses October 2016. The first pair arrived within an acceptable time limit, obstacles taken into consideration (not FDs fault). These felt \"wrong\" when wearing them...as if my vision was skewed. A local optician checked the prescription, and showed me that the Pupil Distance was pretty far off! I wrote to FDs support, and was quickly contacted by JenniferC, who almost immediately sent me an RMA number. Returning the sungalasses took way too long, more than a month in transit (Christmas and all), but even BEFORE Jennifer had received my RMA frames, a new pair of Velocitys had been ordered, prepared and sent to me (I live in Denmark).\n",
      "   Unfortunately, even this pair \"felt wrong\", and the PD was again shown to be off...just not as much this time. Still uncomfortable for me to use, though. It has later been admitted by Serengeti that they have had difficulties in producing an exact PD when making Base 8 wrap lenses (curved lenses), but some people it just doesn't bother at all and they have no problem using them. Unfortunately not me. I'm really sorry that they couldn't make them for me, because I love their glass/lens quality (and have for many years).\n",
      "   JenniferC and AprilB have jumped through hoops to make me a satisfied customer, and we have agreed that I get the full amount that I have payed for the glasses back again. It won't have cost me more than the amount of two return package-fares to find out that Velocity Rx's didn't work for me.\n",
      "   I can with certainty say that FramesDirect has not made a nickel off of me ... quite the contrary ... and yet I am still an utterly satisfied customer. Why, you may ask, when you didn't get what you wanted? Well, because of JenniferC and AprilB...they did what they could with more patience than I myself would have had. Cudos, girls, and thank you for your assistance. I will probably order from you again, when I find the right model!\n",

      "I sold a dress and accurately listed and described the dress (a designer wedding gown lightly used). I even went above and beyond with the seller to send additional videos etc. before the purchase so she knew exactly what she was getting. She was aware there was a no return policy, and but apparently after receiving it decided she wanted to return it so she damaged the dress and sent it back to tradesy returns who took it without communicating ANYTHING to me, the seller. They took the return citing it as \"misrepresented\" on my listing. I received the dress back with new damage from when it was in their possession/the sellers possession and have not been compensated for my sale. \n",
      "TRADESY IS A THIEF!!! I'm now out $75 from shipping and insuring the shipment from sending it to the buyer AND now have what was a beautiful wedding dress with minor wear that has ADDITIONAL DAMAGE AFTER TRADESY HAD IT and they are offering NO compensation for their mistake. In fact, they haven't even responded to the four emails I have sent them today asking for a manager to call me. This issue is NOT resolved and they should be sued. I'm assuming they only gave the buyer credit on the site after her return which means they keep the $1100 from my sale and give me a newly damaged dress back. \n",

      "I want to make everyone aware of internet travel agent/rip off #eDreams. I would give it a 0 if I had that option. \n",
      "My experience with #eDreams has been horrific!!! To say the least. I was supposed to fly on June 23rd from Chicago to Stuttgart, via Dublin. Prior to my flight from Chicago, my fiancé, who is my emergency contact,contacted me telling me that he was notified by edreams that the flight has been delayed by over 1hr. 1st of all I never received the notification, my fiancé did! Shouldn’t I be the 1st to know of changes to the flight I was supposed to be on??? I called #eDreams and I was told that the flight has been cancelled! CANCELLED!!!!!!! I was never told why, but I was told that they would put me on the flight to Stuttgart the next morning. There is no Aerlingus flight from Chicago to Dublin in the morning, so I requested a full refund of my ticket.\n",
      "What happened next is something I don't wish to anybody. 5 hrs prior to my original flight I had no ticket! I was in the airport and the Aerlingus counter was closed! When I called Aerlingus they couldn't help because I booked my flight through an agent, so they directed me to #eDreams. I started searching for other flights, while in the airport, on the little screen of my phone, and all flights were fully booked. I got sick over this situation. While searching desperately for a flight, I thought of checking on the Aerlingus flight that I was supposed to be on originally, to see if it has been cancelled. NO, it has not been cancelled! I was lied to by #eDreams, just like I thought!!! There were 2 more seats left at the time. I had no choice but to buy a $4721.20 versus my initial ticket of $1253.16. Hey, that \"only\" cost me an extra $3468.04!!!! Besides the airport experience, how many times have I called #eDreams to even have my receipt and reservation emailed to me!!! How many times have I called to check on the status of my refund and, after waiting each time to talk to an agent from the \"refunds\" department, I had the phone hung up on me, without the agent or the supervisor even hearing my story? The sick situation I've been put through in an airport 5 hrs prior to my flight, the huge extra amount I had to pay, all because of #eDreams incompetence, should be called eNightmare! \n",
      "I've been reading plenty of reviews from travelers who describe similar situations w/ #eDreams. Someone should look into this scam! Don’t be fooled by the “lower” prices, you’ll most likely end up paying triple!\n",

      "I went to a Mavis for a car state inspection, the technician inspected the car and I noticed he pull my tires off to inspect my cars brakes, before putting my tire back he hit using a hammer the drums maybe to put it in position and it cause it to loose some piece inside the drum probably the auto adjuster and when I left after first 2 mins I felt a bad noise coming from the exact drum that were inspected and hit with the hammer, I drove back to the shop again and the technician lift the car to inspect the drum I notice some pieces fall from the drum (a small coil and a little broken metallic piece) then he went inside the shop and came back after 5 mins to apparently put back the coil, I asked him about what happened and he didn't explain to me what exactly he did to fix my car back, he only said everything is fine right now and because I was in a rush I drove off the shop, right now I have bad feeling, I don't feel safe driving my car because he had to show to me what happened and what he did to fix it, I would like to go to a Mavis shop to have my car lifted and the tech show to me what was done there, thanks\n",

      "It took 2 techs nearly 9 hours to complete the entire process for our small home (under 1200 sq ft.), this was just too long in my opinion. The installation techs were friendly and polite, however, the lead tech made an error when calculating the sensors in my package and I ended up having to pay out of pocket, when I had already made it clear I did not want to do. This package was already discussed over the phone when I set up the appointment, so I did not appreciate the pressure and hassle of having to revisit this. And to further emphasize, I was told over the phone that I would get 2 key fobs, but this was part of the tech's error the day of installation. I'm not a fan of pushy salespeople and so far that is what I have encountered with ADT, throwing in extra yard signs is not my idea of a deal. From what I can tell, the system works fine and we feel safe and that's what matters, but as far as my interactions over the phone and with the installation techs I was not impressed by their honesty or efficiency.\n",
